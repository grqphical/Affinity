Quick Start Guide
-----------------

To make a simple GET request to the `Github
API <https://api.github.com/>`__ you just need to run:

.. code:: bash

   $ affinity https://api.github.com/

Now when you run that you will see:

.. code:: bash

   200 GET https://api.github.com/

To see the data sent from the request add the *-o* flag to output the
results to the console

.. code:: bash

   $ affinity https://api.github.com/ -o
